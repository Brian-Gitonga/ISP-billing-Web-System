Project Summary: Wi-Fi Billing System with MikroTik Router

Project Overview: We are developing a Wi-Fi billing system using a MikroTik router that will enable a voucher-based login for hotspot users.
The main goal is to create a captive portal where users must purchase a voucher to access the internet. Here’s how it will work:

Captive Portal with Voucher Login:

When users connect to the Wi-Fi, they are redirected to a captive portal that requires them to log in using a voucher code.
Users can choose a package (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and pay for it via M-PESA directly from the portal.
Voucher Purchase System:

We’ll create a website that will be accessible even when the user hasn’t paid for the internet.(Microtik router has this feature to make a certain website only)
On this site, users can buy vouchers using M-PESA.
Once the payment is successful, the user will receive a unique voucher code via SMS that allows them to access the internet based on the package they selected.
Automated Code Distribution:

Admin, will generate a set of voucher codes using the MikroTik system and upload them to our website so that when when the user buys a vouncher it can be sent to him/her.
(The microtik router has a feature to generate vouchers)
Each time a user purchases a voucher, the system will automatically send them a unique code, ensuring that each code is only used once.
Why Build This Billing System?

Empowerment and Learning: By building this system, we’ll gain hands-on experience with real-world technologies like MikroTik configuration, payment integration, web development, and SMS gateways.
Revenue Generation: This billing system allows wifi owners to set up a hotspot business, turning a simple Wi-Fi setup into a monetized service where users pay to access the internet.
Tech Skills Development: this will enhance skills in web development, backend programming (PHP, MySQL), and networking, setting a strong foundation for future tech projects.
Solving Real Problems: This system solves a common issue of providing secure, paid internet access, and could be scaled for different environments like hotels, apartments, or public spaces.
